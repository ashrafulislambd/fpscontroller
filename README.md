<h2>First Person Controller for Godot Engine</h2>
<p>This is a shortcut tool for setting up a first person player (specially for FPS games). Just install the asset in godot asset library
and drag the FpsController.tscn file from project pane to scene window. This creates the first person player.</p>

<p>You can set an object being held by the player, such as a gun or flashlight or what ever, by creating a Spatial node as a child of the FpsController.
